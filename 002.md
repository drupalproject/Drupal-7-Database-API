# 数据库配置

The primary means of defining a database connection is via the $databases array in settings.php. As its name suggests, $databases allows for the definition of multiple database connections. It also supports the definition of multiple targets. A database connection is not opened (the connection object is not created) until the first time some piece of code tries to run a query against that database.
