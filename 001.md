Drupal 数据库层是建立在PHP的PDO扩展之上的，PDO 提供了一套统一的，面向对象的接口用来访问不同的数据库引擎，但它没有为不同的数据库SQL方言提供抽象。

## 数据库驱动

Because different databases require different sorts of interaction, the Drupal database layer requires a driver for each database type. A driver consists of a series of files located in includes/database/driver, where driver is a string representing the unique key for that driver. In most cases the driver key is the lowercased version of the database name, such as "mysql", "pgsql", or "mycustomdriver".

Each driver consists of several classes derived from parent classes in the core database system. These driver-specific classes may override whatever behavior is needed to properly support that database type. Driver-specific classes are always named for their parent class followed by an underscore followed by the driver name. For example, the MySQL specific version of InsertQuery is named InsertQuery_mysql.
